## Redmine Bootstrap Kit (v0.1)

As Redmine does not support asset pipeline, we need to install JQuery plugins as Redmine plugins to load them globally.

Current version : [JQuery UI Bootstrap 0.5](http://jquery-ui-bootstrap.github.io/jquery-ui-bootstrap/) - 2014-04-19

Just clone it in your Redmine plugins directory :

    cd REDMINE_ROOT/plugins
    git clone https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_bootstrap_kit.git

Now, within another Redmine plugins, you can call Bootstrap Kit elements :
